Opinions is based on a redesign of Twitter.  
It is an application to share opinions about books, politics, health, etc. - anything that you want to share opinions about with the people who follow you.  
In addition to the project requirements, I added the following features:

  - User can check Likes to the Opinions  
  - Users are presented in 4 modes   
    - All  
    - Most Friendly, those who follow many users  
    - Most Popular, those who are followed by many users  
    - Protagonists, those who have created many Opinions  
  - Links are everywhere, to users, to opinions, to followings apply

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The project creates a database which holds 4 tables:

    - Users : Is the table containing the users' data  
      - Fields :  
        - string:   username  
        - string:   fullname 
        - datetime: created_at  
        - datetime: update_at  

    - Opinions : is the table containing the Opinions' data  
      - Fields:  
        - text:     text  
        - integer:  author_id  
        - datetime: created_at  
        - datetime: update_at  

    - Followings : Is the table that tracks users followings  
      - Fields  
        - integer: follower_id  
        - integer: followed_id  

    - Likes : Is the table that contains the users' likes on the Opinions  
      - Fields  
        - integer: opinion_id  
        - integer: user_id  

Additionally 2 tables are created by the ActiveStorage to keep links to the users' images

  - active_storage_attachments
  - active_storage_blobs

<hr/>

## Extras

  ### Extras to the project requirements are
    - Likes features. The opinions can be liked or unliked by any user
    - Additional listin for the users index, including Most Friendly, Most Popular and Most Productive (Protagonists) users

<hr/>

## Future Features
  ### Following versions may include 
    - Comments on opinions posted by users, such that there is a conversation about each opinion
    - Groups of interest, so opinions are organized in users' selected interests
    - Add images or other media attachements on each post
   
<hr/>

## N+1 Problem

  The n+1 problem is encountered in this project into multiple case.  
  In order to avoid server's overhead, I used aggregated SQL statements and added 'includes' to ActiveRecord instances.  

  #### User Model
  ```

      def self.popular_matrix
        find_by_sql("SELECT users.id, count(followings.id) AS cnt
                    FROM users LEFT JOIN followings ON users.id = followings.followed_id
                    GROUP BY users.id")
      end

      def self.friendly_matrix
        find_by_sql("SELECT users.id, count(followings.id) AS cnt
                    FROM users LEFT JOIN followings ON users.id = followings.follower_id
                    GROUP BY users.id")
      end

      def self.opinions_matrix
        find_by_sql("SELECT users.id, count(opinions.id) AS cnt
                    FROM users LEFT JOIN opinions ON users.id = opinions.author_id
                    GROUP BY users.id")
      end

  ```
#### Users Controller - Index
  ```
  
    @users = User.all.includes(:photo_blob).order(username: :asc)
  
  ```

  #### Opinion Controller
  ```

    @opinions = Opinion.all.includes({ author: :photo_blob }).ordered_by_most_recent
    @to_follow = User.all.where('id NOT IN (?)', User.user_followed(@current_user)).includes(:photo_blob)

  
  ```

Also, at the bottom-right of user's image 2 arrows, one to the left and one to the right, signal the following and followed users.
